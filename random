You are a BI analyst. You have the following tasks:-
1] I want to you to plot monthly sales on a visualization on power bi.
2] I also want to calculate the difference of monthly sales to understand the profit and loss. 
3] I want profit loss measure to be plotted on the same visualization. If there is profit then data value should be green, if there is loss then it should be red.
4] All these measure must be in the same visualization. You must suggest different visualization that can be used to display these two measures effectively and easily.
